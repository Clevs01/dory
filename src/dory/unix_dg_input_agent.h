   Input thread for Dory daemon.  Clients write messages to a UNIX domain
   datagram socket created by the input thread.  The input thread reads the
   messages and passes them to the router thread, which maps messages to Kafka
   brokers and forwards them to the dispatcher for sending.  As messages are
   successfully sent to brokers, the dispatcher returns them to the pool that
   the input thread allocated them from.  The pool enforces a global cap on the
   total amount of buffered message data.  Once the cap is reached, the input
   thread discards additional messages it reads from the UNIX domain socket.

   The intent is to keep the input thread as simple as possible and delegate
   more complex (and possibly time-consuming) behavior to the router thread and
   other threads managed by the router thread.  The input thread's only
   responsibilities are as follows:

     1.  Read messages from the UNIX domain socket and queue them for
         processing by the router thread.  Discard messages when the pool
         memory cap is reached.

     2.  Monitor a file descriptor that becomes readable when the main thread
         receives a shutdown request.  Once it becomes readable, the input
         thread terminates.

   It should be easy to visually inspect the input thread's implementation and
   verify that it will never force clients writing to the UNIX domain socket to
   block for a substantial length of time.
